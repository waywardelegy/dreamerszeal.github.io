<hr>

<p>A secluded young royal. She meets- and quickly befriends- Aera while outside of the castle grounds.<br/>
She's generally very quiet when first met, and is shy due to her upbringing. However, as soon as she feels safe around you, she will not hold herself back from getting overexcited.<br/?
She enjoys taking part in the finer arts, however, she's also a fan of being... Menacing and destructive.</p>

Leena was born to the Royal Family; raised as an only child. She always believed, however, that there was something more to her life- Like someone missing.<br/>
Upon a grave tragedy, she discovers that she might be right, and that her suspicions about Luca aren't all they hide...</p>

She is vaguely named for a distant ancestor (though her parents don't actually... Know that.)</p>

Her magical affinity is ice.</p>

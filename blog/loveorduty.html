 <div><h1><p>Love, or Duty? - An Analysis of Ghaleon and Dyne</h1><br>
Ah, my favorite tried and true topic. I figured I may as well spill my guts with regards to my thoughts on these two.<br/>

<p><img src="dear.png"><br/>
Dearness. What, exactly, is the expression of <i>dearness?</i><br/>
In my interpretation, Ghaleon's heart holds dear only Dyne in an expression of love.</p>

Ghaleon is a very reclusive person due to his past; his loss of Zain and the trauma that preceeded it due to his brother's percieved absence. Someone who could be seen as cold.<br/>
Dyne is the polar opposite of this, an open, loving person; the epitome of warmth. The two are like night and day; cat and dog.</p>

This is already a ship dynamic people love, honestly. But I'm here to go deeper into it.<br/>
See, Ghaleon and Dyne, according to the tankoubons, are a direct parallel of Latona and Zain, featured in VHM Chapter 3.</p>

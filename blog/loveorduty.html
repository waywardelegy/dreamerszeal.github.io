 <div><h1><p>Love, or Duty? - An Analysis of Ghaleon and Dyne</h1><br>
Ah, my favorite tried and true topic. I figured I may as well spill my guts with regards to my thoughts on these two.<br/>

<p><img src="dear.png"></p>
Dearness. What, exactly, is the expression of <i>dearness?</i><br/>
In my interpretation, Ghaleon's heart holds dear only Dyne in an expression of love.</p>

Ghaleon is a very reclusive person due to his past; his loss of Zain and the trauma that preceeded it due to his brother's percieved absence. Someone who could be seen as cold.<br/>
Dyne is the polar opposite of this, an open, loving person; the epitome of warmth. The two are like night and day; cat and dog.</p>

This is already a ship dynamic people love, honestly. But I'm here to go deeper into it.<br/>
See, Ghaleon and Dyne, according to the tankoubons, are a direct parallel of Latona and Zain, featured in VHM Chapter 3.<br/>
Latona is clearly, and aimlessly, in love with Zain. I'm unsure if her feelings were reciprocated, but she ends up lashing out on the humans for taking Zain from her.<br/>

Sound familiar?</p>

Now, I'm not here to talk about how I think the Mazoku are in the right for being furious about the humans gentrifying their land (and dubbing them the Vile Tribe), I'm here to talk about Ghaleon's love for Dyne.<br/>
Maybe I'll talk about Latona and her rage some other time. But she's a direct parallel to Ghaleon's fury towards Althena for taking Dyne from him!<br/>
Remember this?<br/>

Yeah, I'd be pretty furious if the guy I travelled with for ages completely ignored my pleas that what he was doing would bring only despair.</p>

<p>But let's bring it back around to Dyne.<br/>
<img src="vane.png"></p>
Dyne is stupid and sweet. The easiest kind of guy to fall in love with, really.<br/>
Throughout the chapter, he shows interest in a lot of things Ghaleon has to say about his home.<br/>
<img src="companion.png"></p>
He also seems to have a lot of faith in Ghaleon's abilities, and outright refers to him as his <i>companion</i>.<br/>
But when it comes to Ghaleon's emotions, Dyne is oblivious, for the most part.<br/>
In example, Ghaleon has been in despair for many, many years. He hides this well, and Dyne doesn't catch on.<br/>
But when Dyne catches onto Lemia's fear...<br/>
<img src="notice.png"></p>
Ghaleon asks him to ignore it. Hesitantly-- Not in jealousy, but most likely out of a sense of "this is what's best for me, it's probably what's best for her." Yes, Lemia is the deputy guildmistress and pretending not to notice IS for the best, but... You think they could at least show support for her in privacy, right?<br/>
Of course not. Ghaleon thinks hiding emotions is the best way to go about things.</p>

This is further backed up by Ghaleon's silence on this page.<br/>
<img src="care.png"></p>
Ghaleon, upon being asked if keeping composure is painful, just stays silent, immediately after- as noted by sceneryrecalled- Dyne asks why it is he cares about him, with <i>the word "love" being studiously avoided.</i><br/>
Ghaleon's response to being asked why he cares is a blank "I don't know". Followed by silence on the topic of composure. A balance that many people with unrequited feelings may resonate with.<br/>
And that's just the thing. Ghaleon doesn't <i>know</i> what he has until it's gone, so he's able to keep that composure on the topic.</p>

<img src="begging.png"></p>
It's only when Dyne appeals to him in a moment of hopelessness that Ghaleon snaps out of his usual defeatist attitude. The airship means a lot to him, but more importantly, Dyne means a lot to him.<br/>
<img src="pray.png"></p>
Ghaleon tells Dyne and Lemia to pray. Pray to Althena. A goddess of love and light.<br/>
He then performs his magic...<br/>
<img src="magic2.png"></p>
Which he goes on to state is something that's based in what the person wishes for most.<br/>
My perception here is that Ghaleon's not wishing for the safety of the airship, which Dyne doesn't know is important to him... But for whatever Dyne and Lemia want.<br/>
Knowing that Lemia's happiness would make Dyne happy; Ghaleon prays for that.<br/>
<img src="magic.png"></p>
Because after all, at its most primal, that's what magic is: Love.</p>

In my eyes, the duo each represent a half of the "love or duty" ultimatum Ghaleon proposes to Alex.<br/>
Ghaleon is representative of love- strong, uncontrollable, sometimes painful. Someone with magic. Dyne is the opposite, a representative of duty; responsible and calm, even if he knows it's not the best thing for everyone. Someone who lacks magic.<br/>
Ghaleon loses Dyne, and that's when he realizes just how much he's lost, and how important it was to him. Sure, some of it may be a reaction to having lost more before that- his brother, his land, his people- but his rage is directed towards the loss of Dyne, towards <i>Althena, who took him away.</i></p>

<p>But of course... The story of Ghaleon's rage... Is a tale for another day.</p>

<p>I've been taking ADHD meds for the past few days and have been feeling great. Sadly, great things never last.<br/>
My retainer broke. Essentially; I wear a retainer with two fake teeth on it, to hold open a gap and pretend I have those teeth still until I get implants.<br/>
The teeth broke off of it, and now there's a sharp piece of plastic right in tongue-touching range. Not fun! My mood dipped pretty bad last night because of it.</p>

<p>In brighter news, I'm currently working on my first non-personal blog entry. What is it, you might be wondering?<br/>
<img src="loveordutyprev.png"><br/>
As expected, it's a long-winded journal entry on how in love Ghaleon and Dyne are.<br/>
They mean a lot to me from many perspectives and I'm excited to share my thoughts.</p>

<p>Additionally, I'm putting more work into To Time's End. Also very excited to share that, though I might change the format it's in if I can't find many voice actors for it.<br/>
I've started uploading character bios to this site, too: <a href="http://waywardelegy.xyz/works/tte/aera.html">Aera</a>, <a href="http://waywardelegy.xyz/works/tte/luca.html">Luca</a>, and <a href="http://waywardelegy.xyz/works/tte/leena.html">Leena</a>!</p>

<p>I've figured out my plan for the right sidebar, as well. It'll feature links to non-personal blog entries, like the above mentioned Ghaleon/Dyne entry!<br/>
I'm really happy with this site so far and can't wait to keep growing it.</p>

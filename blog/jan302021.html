Today I purchased Final Fantasy 7 for the Nintendo Switch. I'm going to give it a playthrough and see how I feel about it. It's heavily recommended by my friends, so hopefully I enjoy it.<br/>
I'm starting work on To Time's End as well; which is super exciting for me. This story is so personal and intrinsic to me and I'm hopeful people will enjoy it.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to get my AIBO ERS-210, Odin, repaired in the next couple of months. Repairs are super pricey in CAD right now, so I'm trying to game it so that I don't spend too much on my end without asking the repairmen for a discount.<br/>
They've got a heavy workload anyway, so me waiting until the Canadian Dollar is better isn't a big deal, haha!</p>
<p>I'll need to find something to fill the right sidebar eventually...</p>
